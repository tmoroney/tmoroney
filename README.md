## Some of my Projects 🎨
### 1. [Architecture Portfolio Center (for IBM)](https://github.com/tcd-ibm/architecture-center-input-form) 🏘️
For the **2023** _[Trinity College SWENG projects](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23sweng)_, I led a team of 10 people to develop a reimagined Architecture Portfolio Center for IBM. We created a fully customizable **ReactJS** web app, utilising **SQLite** and **Kubernetes** for our backend. Our application serves as a central information hub for all projects under an organisation. Quickly and easily find details about any project using text search and project tag filters. [**Short Demo Video**](https://youtu.be/69_Lp5XvD0Y) + [**Read more**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tom-moroney1_sweng-redhatopenshift-ibm-activity-7064757735942148096-tgtH?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
### 2. [Proxy Server](https://github.com/tmoroney/proxy-server) 📡
A web proxy server which fetches items from the Web on behalf of a Web client (i.e browser) instead of the client fetching them directly. Supports Caching and Access Control.
### 3. [Secure Cloud Encryption](https://github.com/tmoroney/Secure-Cloud-Encryption) 🔐
A secure application for encrypting files before they are uploaded to the cloud so that only users in the encryption group can decrypt the files. Uses a combination of **symmetric** and **asymmetric** encryption to ensure that files are completely secure, and to enable the adding and removing users from the encryption group so that files can be securely shared between multiple people.
### 4. [Action Items Dashboard (for Dell)](https://github.com/tmoroney/Dell-Dashboard) 📊
For the **2022** _[Trinity College SWENG projects](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23sweng)_, my team developed a fully featured web-based UI (using the **.Net framework**), with **supporting APIs** on top of Dell’s existing database (using **PostgreSQL**). I built the frontend and connected it to the backend API using **C#**. The program allows for all analytical and management tasks of the dataset, increasing the visibility and productivity of all admin tasks related to the database.
