## Some of my Projects 🎨
### 1. [Architecture Portfolio Center (for IBM)](https://github.com/tcd-ibm/architecture-center-input-form) 🧱
As part of the **2023** _[Trinity College SWENG projects](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23sweng)_, IBM tasked my team with creating a reimagined Architecture Portfolio Center. We took inspiration from an open-source project and transformed it into a fully customizable **ReactJS** web app. Our application serves as a centralized hub, eliminating the need to navigate through various project management tools commonly used within an organization. It provides a streamlined platform where all projects under an organisation can be showcased and conveniently filtered.

### 2. [Proxy Server](https://github.com/tmoroney/proxy-server) 📡
A web proxy server which fetches items from the Web on behalf of a Web client (i.e browser) instead of the client fetching them directly. Supports Caching and Access Control.
### 3. [Secure Cloud Encryption](https://github.com/tmoroney/Secure-Cloud-Encryption) 🔐
A secure application for encrypting files before they are uploaded to the cloud so that only users in the encryption group can decrypt the files. Uses a combination of **symmetric** and **asymmetric** encryption to ensure that files are completely secure, and to enable the adding and removing users from the encryption group so that files can be securely shared between multiple people.
### 4. [Action Items Dashboard (for Dell)](https://github.com/tmoroney/Dell-Dashboard) 📊
For the **2022** _[Trinity College SWENG projects](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23sweng)_, my team developed a fully featured web-based UI (using the **.Net framework**), with **supporting APIs** on top of Dell’s existing database (using **PostgreSQL**). I built the frontend and connected it to the backend API using **C#**. The program allows for all analytical and management tasks of the dataset, increasing the visibility and productivity of all admin tasks related to the database.
